Developed a secure and scalable Blood & Organ Donation Management System using MySQL, NoSQL, and ETL workflows. The system manages 1,000+ donor, patient, and hospital records, improving allocation efficiency, reducing manual work, and enabling faster, data-driven decisions.
⚙️ Methods
Database Design: Built relational schemas in MySQL and integrated NoSQL pipelines for flexibility
ETL Workflows: Automated preprocessing and record updates across hospitals, blood banks, and transplant centers
SQL Queries: Implemented joins, nested queries, and aggregates for efficient donor–recipient matching
Visualization: Python-based bar, pie, and histogram plots for donation trends
📈 Results
Improved blood & organ allocation efficiency by 40%
Reduced manual record-keeping effort by 40%
Enabled faster donor–recipient matching and hospital-level reporting
